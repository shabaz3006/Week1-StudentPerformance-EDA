# 📊 Student Performance EDA Project

This beginner-friendly project analyzes how student performance in Math, Reading, and Writing is affected by various factors such as gender, parental level of education, lunch type, and test preparation.

## 📁 Dataset
- Dataset Name: StudentsPerformance.csv
- Fields: gender, parental level of education, lunch, test preparation course, math score, reading score, writing score

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- pandas (for data handling)
- matplotlib & seaborn (for data visualization)

## ✅ Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Checked for missing values
3. Analyzed score patterns by different categories
4. Visualized the data using graphs
5. Summarized insights
6. Cleaned and documented the notebook

## 📌 Key Insights
- Female students scored higher in reading and writing.
